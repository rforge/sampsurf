<h2><a name="Overview"></a>Overview of the sampSurf package</h2>

<p> The <Rpkg>sampSurf</Rpkg> package can be used to construct sampling surface
simulations for different areal sampling methods common to forestry and ecology. Areal
sampling methods in general would include fixed-area plot methods, line intersect
sampling, and various variable-radius plot sampling methods, the latter more commonly used
in forestry. Most of these fall under the general probability proportional to size
(<acronym>pps</acronym>) umbrella and have some form of inclusion zone associated with
each individual in the population. The inclusion zone has well-defined area (sometimes
called the inclusion area) and may be thought of simply as that zone within which a sample
point could fall and select the associated individual. The sample point can be the center
of a circular fixed-area plot, an actual point as in horizontal point sampling, or say,
the midpoint of a line in line intersect sampling.
</p>

<p>
In general we are interested in determining the properties of various sampling methods
mentioned above when applied to fixed objects such as standing trees or down logs. The
<Rpkg>sampSurf</Rpkg> package will allow generation of log or tree populations within a
fixed tract area. The surface generated from the intersection of inclusion zones applied
to the individuals in the population for a given attribute (e.g., volume, number of
individuals, etc.) are represented by the "sampSurf" class and can be displayed
graphically. Estimator variance is directly associated with the sampling surface
roughness, and so methods can also be compared visually.
<!--An example of a graphical
depiction of a sampling surface using the "sausage" method may be
viewed <a href="./ssExample.pdf">here</a>. -->
</p>

<p>
There are several vignettes associated with the package that provide detailed explanation
and examples of the design and use of the various components. A good place to start is
with <em>The sampSurf Package Overview</em> vignette, which provides an overview of the
class structure, etc. The vignettes are all available from the package index help page
once the package has been installed and loaded using <Rcode>library()</Rcode>. Another
overview of the package in the help system can be found by
issuing <Rcode>package?sampSurf</Rcode> at the R command line. This help page will provide
links to all of the built-in class structure, generics with associated methods, and helper
functions. Running the examples (with R's <Rcode>example()</Rcode> command) will also
provide some help in getting started.
</p>

<p>
<Rpkg>sampSurf</Rpkg> is quite functional, and has support for down logs sampled on
fixed-area plots (which include the <sq>stand-up,</sq> <sq>sausage,</sq>
and <sq>chainsaw</sq> methods or protocols), point relascope sampling, several variants of
perpendicular distance sampling, as well as a new method called distance limited sampling
and a Monte Carlo variant.  Standing trees sampling methods are also supported
with classes and methods for fixed-area circular plot and horizontal point and line
sampling methods, as well as critical height and some new importance sampling-based
derivatives of the latter. The overall class structure is designed to support additions
with relative ease, so more methods will appear in future releases (hopefully with some
contributed by users). At the current release, there are more than 20 variants of sampling
methods available in the package (see <Rcode>package?sampSurf</Rcode> and the vignettes
for details).
</p>





<!-- ============================================================================================== -->
<h2><a name="Installation"></a>sampSurf installation</h2>

<p>
<Rpkg>sampSurf</Rpkg> is now on CRAN. It is probably best to install it from there as the
version here at R-Forge might not always be fully functional. However, if you do desire to
use the version here, please read what follows as it may help.
</p>


<p>
On the project pages, you will note that you can install the package directly from R-Forge
using&hellip;<br><br>

<Rcode>install.packages("sampSurf", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")</Rcode><br><br>

and can include the <Rcode>dep=TRUE</Rcode> argument if you want the packages
that <Rpkg>sampSurf</Rpkg> is dependent upon to also be installed. Unfortunately,
installing the dependencies in this way may be a little difficult. First, I believe that
the dependencies are only searched for on R-Forge, and not CRAN (you could add more repos
to the list to compensate). Since <Rpkg>raster</Rpkg> and <Rpkg>rgl</Rpkg> are both
R-Forge projects, they will be found. But <Rpkg>gpclib</Rpkg>, for example, is not on
R-Forge and therefore R will complain that it can not find it. Second, the packages that
are available on R-Forge could be in some intermediate stage of update, so it is better to
install the required packages from CRAN, with what is known to be a stable release. The
dependencies are listed in the DESCRIPTION file for <Rpkg>sampSurf</Rpkg>, they are:
<Rpkg>sp</Rpkg>, <Rpkg>raster</Rpkg>, <Rpkg>rasterVis</Rpkg>,
<Rpkg>rgeos</Rpkg> and <Rpkg>boot</Rpkg>, with <Rpkg>rgl</Rpkg> suggested but not
necessary unless you want to look at the sampling surfaces in 3D. Therefore, I would
recommend that you use the normal
<Rcode>install.packages()</Rcode> on all these packages so that you get the latest stable
version from CRAN. Here is what I would try (in this order)&hellip;<br><br>

<Rcode>install.packages("sp")</Rcode><br>
<Rcode>install.packages("raster")</Rcode><br>
<Rcode>install.packages("rasterVis")</Rcode><br>
<Rcode>install.packages("rgeos")</Rcode><br>
<Rcode>install.packages("boot")</Rcode><br>
<Rcode>install.packages("sampSurf", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")</Rcode><br><br>

This should do it and get the correct stable releases from CRAN prior to installing
<Rpkg>sampSurf</Rpkg>. Please note that as of <Rpkg>sampSurf</Rpkg> version 0.6-6
(26-Nov-2012), <Rpkg>rgeos</Rpkg> has replaced <Rpkg>gpclib</Rpkg> due to the limited use
license restriction on the latter (see this package on CRAN). Please see the instructions
for installing  <Rpkg>rgeos</Rpkg> if any problems arise.
</p>


<h3>Enabling the R help system</h3>

<p>
One other thing that some R users may not be getting the full advantage of is the html
help system. This really should be set up to work correctly in your <Code>.Rprofile</Code>
file to get help via your web browser, using the local help file installation for each
package (not just <Rpkg>sampSurf</Rpkg>). This will also enable you to see all of the
vignette files for this package, which provide extensive documentation in PDF format. With
the new dynamic help system that came in version 2.10.0, add these lines (with appropriate
browser) to your <Code>.Rprofile</Code>&hellip;<br><br>

<Rcode>options(help_type = 'html')</Rcode><br>
<Rcode>options(browser='firefox')</Rcode><br><br>

That should do it on Linux, I have not tested this on other platforms, but it probably
will work. Now when you do something like <Rcode>package?sampSurf</Rcode> at the R command
line, you will get the response in your browser with hyper links to other useful pages.
</p>


<h3><Rpkg>rgl</Rpkg> Installation</h3>

<p>
On Linux, the <Rpkg>rgl</Rpkg> package requires system dependencies. The freeglut and mesa
libraries must be installed. But in addition, the <em>development</em> versions of
freeglut and libpng must also be install for <Rpkg>rgl</Rpkg> to run. On Fedora, these
are <Code>freeglut-devel</Code> and <Code>libpng-devel</Code> which could be installed
with <Code>yum</Code> prior to installing <Rpkg>rgl</Rpkg> within R. If you use windows or
OS X, unfortunately I can not be of any help (but please let me know so I can post
instructions here for others if there is anything extra one has to do to
get <Rpkg>rgl</Rpkg> working on those systems).
</p>

<h3><Rpkg>sampSurf</Rpkg> package vignettes</h3>

<p>
As noted above, there are a number of package vignettes distributed with the package
itself. These can also be downloaded here from the R-Forge versions if desired&hellip;

<h2><a name="Examples"></a>sampSurf examples</h2>



<p>
Here we present some very simple examples illustrating how to use a few of the main
functions in the <Rpkg>sampSurf</Rpkg> package. The vignettes go into extensive detail
concerning the use of the methods shown below. In addition, the online help system is
quite thorough in documenting class structures, generic functions, and their
methods. Therefore, we have provided just a very terse set of examples to show a little of
the functionality of the package here.
</p>

<p>
In general, there are two main ways to create a sampling surface: (1) simple, usually
"one-off" construction, or (2) progressive, by constructing intermediate elements that can
be re-used for comparison of methods, etc. Both will be demonstrated below.
</p>



<h3> Simple sampling surface construction </h3>

<p>
The first example shows how to create a sampling surface "on-the-fly," as it were, by
hiding the intermediate steps used in building the surface. The only exception is that we
always need some form of <Rclass>Tract</Rclass> object to be created ahead of time with the desired
extents and resolution. This method is simple, but it does not easily allow for reuse of elements
(e.g., the stem population, though it can be extracted if desired for reuse) in comparing
other attribute surfaces, or different sampling methods. 




<p> 
The first component that is always required for a completed sampling surface is a <Rclass>Tract</Rclass>
object with defined extents and resolution&hellip;
</p>

<div class="chunk" id="unnamed-chunk-3"><div class="rcode"><div class="source"><pre class="knitr r"><span class="functioncall">require</span>(sampSurf)
tract.m = <span class="functioncall">Tract</span>(<span class="functioncall">c</span>(x = 71, y = 71), cellSize = 0.5)  #<span class="keyword">in</span> meters
buffTract.m = <span class="functioncall">bufferedTract</span>(bufferWidth = 10, tract.m)
</pre></div></div></div>


<p>
In the above example, we have first made a <Rclass>Tract</Rclass> object in metric (SI) units with no
buffer that is one half hectare in area (71x71m), and has a grid resolution of 0.5m. The
second step creates a buffered version with a 10m internal buffer. The two steps could, of
course, be combined into one, but they are separated here for clarity. The internal buffer
is generally set large enough that no inclusion zones will overlap the outer tract
boundary; thus, eliminating concern for boundary slopover issues.
</p>

<p>
Next, simply run the <Rcode>sampSurf</Rcode> constructor to create an object of that class
with the desired number of, in this case, downed logs (first argument). The sampling
method to apply to the logs is passed in the <Rcode>iZone</Rcode> argument; e.g.,&hellip;
</p>

<div class="chunk" id="sausageLen"><div class="rcode"><div class="source"><pre class="knitr r">R&gt; sausageLen.ss = <span class="functioncall">sampSurf</span>(20, tract = buffTract.m, iZone = <span class="string">'sausageIZ'</span>, 
+                          plotRadius = 3, estimate = <span class="string">'Length'</span>, 
+                          buttDiams = <span class="functioncall">c</span>(20, 50), logLens = <span class="functioncall">c</span>(2, 8))
</pre></div><div class="output"><pre class="knitr r">
Number of logs in collection = 20
Heaping log: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,
</pre></div><div class="source"><pre class="knitr r">R&gt; <span class="functioncall">plot</span>(sausageLen.ss, useImage = <span class="keyword">FALSE</span>)
</pre></div></div><div class="rimage default"><img src="figures/ss-sausageLen.png" title="plot of chunk sausageLen" alt="plot of chunk sausageLen" class="plot" /></div></div>


<p> Notice that you can specify the default log dimensions (e.g., <Rcode>buttDiams</Rcode>
  for the range in large-end log diameters) that will be used in creating the synthetic
  log population for this simulation. The <Rcode>plotRadius</Rcode> argument specifies the
  radius of the <sq>sausage-shaped</sq> inclusion zone to be associated with each
  log. The <Rcode>plot</Rcode> function shows a two-dimensional display of the sampling
  surface, with down logs plotted by default. The logs are created so that their midpoints
  (both longitudinal and radial) fall within the internal buffer of
  the <Rclass>bufferedTract</Rclass> object. Choosing a plot radius that keeps all of the
  inclusion zones within the tract for the longest possible log will ensure that all
  inclusion zones fit within the tract, eliminating boundary slopover issues. The
  constructor will warn you if any inclusion zones overlap the tract boundary.
</p>


<p>
 A summary of the object is often useful&hellip;

Printing the object in the first line, displays the specification on the

the <Rpkg>raster</Rpkg> package. Using <Rcode>summary</Rcode> on the object returns
information about the sampling statistics for the object.
</p>

<p>
We can also display the surface nicely using the <Rpkg>rgl</Rpkg> package; take a minute
to compare this to the two-dimensional display to see how the surface builds as inclusion
zones overlap&hellip;

<p>
Note that sampling for log length under the sausage sampling protocol of fixed-area plot
sampling yields a constant height surface for each log, which varies between logs. This
method is a probability proportional to length estimation method, and normally the heights
would be constant for all logs under such a design. But sausage sampling is a little
different in this respect because of the way the inclusion area is determined.




<h3>Detailed sampling surface construction </h3>

<p>
In this section we will look at elaborating on what was done in the previous section by
showing how a sampling surface can be built by creating most of the intermediate objects
"by hand." (I say "most" here because <Rclass>InclusionZoneGrid</Rclass> objects are
automatically created by the <Rcode>sampSurf</Rcode> constructor.) The basic steps are as
follows&hellip;

<ol>
<li> Create a <Rclass>Tract</Rclass> object.</li>
<li> Create a population of synthetic stems in the form of logs or trees.</li>
<li> If need be, create an <Rclass>ArealSampling</Rclass> object with the specifications
  for the method.</li>
<li> Combine the stem population and the sampling method in the last two steps
  and form the population of <Rclass>InclusionZone</Rclass> objects.</li>
<li> Create the sampling surface from the collection in the previous step.</li>
</ol>

Some sampling methods or protocols do not require you to explicitly create an object that
describes the sampling method in step 3; these include the fixed-area plot methods, where
one simply specifies a plot radius. All other methods require information on design
parameters as we will see below.
</p>

<p>
We will use the <Rclass>Tract</Rclass> object from the first example. In this example, we will look at
another down coarse woody debris sampling method known as perpendicular distance sampling
(<acronym>pds</acronym>). Start by creating a population of down logs&hellip;
</p>

<div class="chunk" id="dLogs"><div class="rcode"><div class="source"><pre class="knitr r">R&gt; dLogs = <span class="functioncall">downLogs</span>(25, buffTract.m, buttDiams = <span class="functioncall">c</span>(25, 50), logLens = <span class="functioncall">c</span>(5, 10))

</pre></div></div><div class="rimage default"><img src="figures/ss-dLogs.png" title="plot of chunk dLogs" alt="plot of chunk dLogs" class="plot" /></div></div>


<p>
We created a population of rather long, and large-diameter logs so they display nicely on
the plot (remember, this is a metric example, and the <Rcode>buttDiams</Rcode> argument is in
cm). The collection is created using the <Rcode>downLogs</Rcode> object constructor. The
second line prints some summary information about the collection.
</p>

<p>
Next, since we know we want to use <acronym>pds</acronym>, we need to create an object
that contains the information about that sampling method in the form of design parameters
for the distance limit. This is most easily done in terms of a
"K<sub><acronym>pds</acronym></sub> factor" for the method&hellip;

<div class="chunk" id="unnamed-chunk-7"><div class="rcode"><div class="source"><pre class="knitr r">R&gt; pds.m = <span class="functioncall">perpendicularDistance</span>(50, description = <span class="string">"PDS parameters"</span>)

perpendicularDistance...
  kPDS factor = 50 per meter [or dimensionless] for volume [surface/coverage area]
  volume [surface/coverage area] factor = 100 cubic meters [square meters] per hectare
</pre></div></div></div>


<p> The default is for metric units as we can see in the object summary. The associated
volume, surface and coverage areas are determined for this particular
K<sub><acronym>pds</acronym></sub> factor and are also shown in the summary. I don't want
to get into the structure of the package classes too much at this point, but the summary
shows that the <Rclass>perpendicularDistance</Rclass> class is a subclass of
<Rclass>ArealSampling,</Rclass> and the pertinent information for both classes is shown
(i.e., the subclass inherits the <Rcode>units</Rcode> slot information from the
superclass). With regard to the volume (surface or coverage area)
factor, <acronym>pds</acronym> is a probability proportional to volume (surface or
coverage area) sampling method, depending on which protocol is selected in the next step
(where the inclusion zones are created). Therefore, each log counted on a sample point
contributes, in this case, 100m<sup>3</sup> (or 100m<sup>2</sup>) of volume (surface or
coverage area) to the estimate.
</p>


<p>
The next step is to combine the collection of down logs and the appropriate sampling
method parameters (the last two objects created above) and make the inclusion zones for
each log. In the end, what we want is a collection of inclusion zones, one for each log,
to match the <Rcode>dLogs</Rcode> object created above. The <Rpkg>sampSurf</Rpkg> package
has "container classes" to help with this. For example, the <Rcode>dLogs</Rcode> object is
a container of individual down log (class <Rclass>downLog</Rclass>) objects. Likewise, the
following creates a container of all the individual inclusion zone objects. It does this
by applying the <Rcode>perpendicularDistanceIZ</Rcode> constructor method to each log in
the collection&hellip;

<p>
Note that the <Rcode>downLogIZs</Rcode> constructor method creates the collection, and can
work with any sampling method known to sampSurf that can be applied to sampling down logs
(there's a companion method for standing trees as we will see in the next section). A
summary of the collection is then printed showing some statistics on the inclusion zone
areas (use <Rcode>hist</Rcode> on this object to display a histogram of the areas). Next,
as a quick check to make sure all zones lie within the <Rclass>Tract</Rclass> object, the
collection is plotted over the tract. Finally, we chose sampling with probability
proportional to volume in this example (the <Rcode>pdsType</Rcode> argument). Therefore,
the shape of the individual inclusion zones is an inflated version of each log's
individual taper in terms of cross-sectional area along the stem (the integral of
cross-sectional area is volume).
</p>

Of course now the last step is simply to create the sampling surface from the objects we
have built in the previous steps. The sampling surface will be for volume in this
case&hellip;

<p>
Note in the summary that the method is unbiased. And, as in the first example, we can
visualize the surface using <Rpkg>rgl</Rpkg>&hellip;
</p>




<div class="chunk" id="pdsVol-rgl"><div class="rcode"><div class="source"><pre class="knitr r">R&gt; <span class="functioncall">require</span>(rgl)
R&gt; <span class="functioncall">plot3D</span>(dLogs.ss)

</pre></div></div><div class="rimage center"><img src="figures/ss-pdsVol-rgl.png" title="plot of chunk pdsVol-rgl" alt="plot of chunk pdsVol-rgl" class="plot" /></div></div>





<p>
Because we are sampling with probability proportional to volume, and estimating volume,
the volume estimate for each log is the same and it gets spread evenly over its inclusion
zone under <acronym>pds</acronym>. Also, since each log accounts for the same estimate
(the volume factor), we get an even stair-step "heaping" of the surface where the
inclusion zones intersect. This is the more normal case when you are sampling to estimate
the "design attribute" that the method is optimized in terms of; the sausage protocol
above is an exception to this rule.
</p>



<h3>A final example </h3>

<p>
In the previous examples we have ignored standing trees and English units. Here we will
rectify this. The steps presented below are the same as those outlined in the previous
section, except they are applied to standing trees (and of course, the vignettes have much
more detail on each step). You can look at
(e.g., <Rcode>print</Rcode>, <Rcode>plot</Rcode>, <Rcode>hist</Rcode>, etc.) the objects
created below to get more familiar with the package&hellip;

<p>
Note in the figures that larger trees represent fewer trees per acre, and thus have lower
surface height than smaller trees. Some sampling methods (or protocols for a given method)
even have variable height surfaces within individual inclusion zones for each stem,
perhaps you'll stumble across these in the use of this package.
</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
The examples presented assume some knowledge of the subject area with respect to areal
sampling methods. Hopefully one can get an idea of what is involved in using the package
and some uses it might be put to by comparing different (or new) methods on the sample
stem populations. The vignettes provide much more detail and both they and the help pages
have references to some of the more recent papers on both the sampling methods and the
sampling surface concept. Please let me know if you've found <Rpkg>sampSurf</Rpkg> useful,
or find any problems.
