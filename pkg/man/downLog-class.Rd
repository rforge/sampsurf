\title{Class "downLog": Representation of Downed Logs}
\description{
  A subclass of virtual class \dQuote{\code{\linkS4class{Stem}}} that can be used to
  represent downed coarse woody debris in the form of something
  resembling a log. The class provides for creation and graphical
  display of \dQuote{downLog} objects.

  Detail examples and information concerning this class is found in
  \dQuote{The Stem Class} vignette, which should be consulted for more
  details on creating and using objects from this class.
}

\section{Objects from the Class}{  
Objects can be created by calls of the form \code{new("downLog", ...)}.
However, this is \emph{not} recommended. The object has a number of
slots that require establishment that can be somewhat complex to
calculate. Therefore, a constructor function \code{\link{downLog}} has
been provided that will make the desired object with the correct values
for the slots. It is strongly recommended that one use this generic's
methods to create the log objects.
}

\section{Slots}{
  In addition to the slots provided by the virtual superclass
  \dQuote{\code{\linkS4class{Stem}}}, the following slots are represented\ldots
  \describe{
    \item{\code{buttDiam}:}{Object of class \code{"numeric"}: the log
	  diameter at the large (butt) end in the proper units. For both
	  "English" and "metric" the diameters are in the \emph{same} units
	  as length, i.e., meters for metric. }
    \item{\code{topDiam}:}{Object of class \code{"numeric"}: The
	  small-end diameter of the log. }
    \item{\code{logLen}:}{Object of class \code{"numeric"}: The log
	  length in meters or feet. }
    \item{\code{logAngle}:}{Object of class \code{"numeric"}: An angle
	  for the log's position established from the center of the log
	  relative to its "needle." The center of the log is equidistant
	  from both ends along the established needle. On a straight log,
	  the needle would correspond to the pith if everything were perfect. }
    \item{\code{solidType}:}{Object of class \code{"numeric"}: The form
	  parameter in the simple taper and volume equation presented in Van
	  Deusen (1990) and Gove and Van Deusen (2011).}
    \item{\code{logVol}:}{Object of class \code{"numeric"}: The log's volume. }
    \item{\code{taper}:}{Object of class \code{"data.frame"}: The log's
	  taper, either as specified from measurements, or as generated via
	  \code{\link{downLog}}. }
    \item{\code{profile}:}{Object of class \code{"data.frame"}: The log
	  profile as generated from the taper. The log is assumed to be
	  oriented with the small-end North, and the base at the origin. }
    \item{\code{rotLog}:}{Object of class \code{"matrix"}: A rotated and
	translated version of \code{profile} using \code{logAngle} and
	\code{location} fields. }
    \item{\code{spLog}:}{Object of class \code{"SpatialPolygons"}: A
	  \code{\linkS4class{SpatialPolygons}} representation of \code{rotLog} via the
	  \code{\link{sp}} package. }
    \item{\code{slNeedleAxis}:}{Object of class \code{"SpatialLines"}: A
	fully transformed (rotated and translated) representation of the
	needle for the log as a \code{\linkS4class{SpatialLines}} object
	from package \code{\link{sp}}. }

\section{Methods}{
  \describe{
    \item{bbox}{\code{signature(obj = "downLog")}: Returns the bounding
       box for the object. }
    \item{chainSawIZ}{\code{signature(downLog = "downLog", plotRadius =
       "numeric")}: Chainsaw method inclusion zone constructor. }
    \item{plot}{\code{signature(x = "downLog", y = "missing")}:
       Graphically display a "downLog" object. }
    \item{sausageIZ}{\code{signature(downLog = "downLog", plotRadius =
       "numeric")}: Sausage sampling inclusion zone constructor. }
    \item{standUpIZ}{\code{signature(downLog = "downLog", plotRadius =
       "numeric")}: Stand-up method inclusion zone constructor. }
    \item{summary}{\code{signature(object = "downLog")}: Summary of the object. }
	%note: show() defaults to summary for downLogs, so no explicit
	%method here
